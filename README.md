# Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

Problem:
The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.


Project Description:
In this project, there is another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application passes the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems.
Taking it a step further, the project makes use of the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This improve thes answers returned from the queries.
